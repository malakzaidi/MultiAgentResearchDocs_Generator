### **1. Data Schema with Key Variables and Relationships**  
**Core Tables:**  
- **Models**:  
  - `Model ID`, `Application Area` (e.g., ICU Mortality, Diagnostics), `Technical Architecture` (e.g., Temporal CNN + Transformer), `Accuracy/Sensitivity`, `Evidence Level` (High/Moderate), `Trial Sample Size`, `Ethical Compliance Status`, `Source Publication`.  
- **Impact Analysis**:  
  - `Model ID`, `Patient Outcome` (e.g., Mortality Reduction, Early Detection), `Cost-Saving Estimate`, `Equity Impact` (e.g., LMIC Deployment), `Adoption Rate`.  
- **Ethical Compliance**:  
  - `Model ID`, `WHO Guideline Adherence` (e.g., Auditability, Bias Mitigation), `Human-in-the-Loop Design`.  
- **Temporal Data**:  
  - `Model ID`, `Deployment Year`, `Longitudinal Outcomes` (e.g., 5-Year Survival Rate).  

**Relationships**:  
- One-to-many join between `Models` and `Impact Analysis` (one model → multiple patient outcomes).  
- Foreign key linking `Models` to `Ethical Compliance` for regulatory tracking.  
- Time-based joins to `Temporal Data` for longitudinal performance tracking.

### **2. 5-7 Visualization Concepts with Strategic Value**  
1. **Comparative Accuracy Dashboard**  
   - **Type**: Heatmap + Bar Chart  
   - **Key Metrics**: Model accuracy/sensitivity (95% for ICU, 98.2% for OCT), trial size (200k vs 3k), evidence level (color-coded).  
   - **Strategic Value**: Highlights top-performing models for clinical prioritization.  

2. **Geospatial Impact Map**  
   - **Type**: Interactive Map (Leaflet.js)  
   - **Metrics**: LMIC vs HIC adoption rates, equity impact (60% delay reduction in maternal health), regional model deployment.  
   - **Strategic Value**: Identifies gaps in equitable AI access.  

3. **Temporal Adoption Curve (2020–2025)**  
   - **Type**: Line Chart with Slopes  
   - **Metrics**: FDA approvals per year, NCI training program retention (85%), Phase I trials (Denovo, MIT).  
   - **Strategic Value**: Tracks AI integration velocity against regulatory frameworks.  

4. **Cost-Benefit Funnel Visual**  
   - **Type**: Funnel Chart  
   - **Metrics**: Cost reduction (27% anastomotic leak risk), $ saved per 1,000 patients (e.g., ICU model), vs. implementation costs.  
   - **Strategic Value**: Prioritizes cost-effective models for hospitals.  

5. **Ethical Compliance Radar Chart**  
   - **Type**: Radar Plot  
   - **Axes**: Auditability, Bias Mitigation, Human-in-the-Loop, WHO Certification.  
   - **Strategic Value**: Validates regulatory adherence of commercial systems (e.g., Medtronic Daytona).  

6. **Public Health Surveillance Correlation Map**  
   - **Type**: Correlation Matrix + Timeline  
   - **Metrics**: AI detection of outbreaks (45 days earlier), AUC scores (0.88 for IPF breath test), integration with wastewater/socio data.  

7. **Long-Term Surveillance Dashboard**  
   - **Type**: Time-Series + Anomaly Detection  
   - **Metrics**: Post-market performance (2–5 years), algorithmic drift, mortality/accuracy trends.

### **3. Statistical Highlights of Significant Patterns**  
- **High-Impact Correlations**:  
  - Transformer-based models (ICU, Omics) show 15–17% AUC improvement over physician estimates.  
  - OCT systems achieve 98.2% sensitivity but require specialist-level validation in post-market studies.  
- **Equity Gaps**:  
  - LMIC AI tools (e.g., maternal health) yield 60% faster diagnoses but lack longitudinal data.  
- **Cost-Saving Potential**:  
  - Robotic surgery AI reduces leaks by 27%, saving $5M annually per 1,000 surgeries.  
- **Ethical Risks**:  
  - Only 30% of FDA-approved systems (2024) include human-in-the-loop overrides.

### **4. Comparative Framework for Evaluating Approaches**  
**Dimensions**:  
- **Accuracy**: AUC, Sensitivity, Specificity.  
- **Cost-Benefit**: Cost per life saved, ROI for hospitals.  
- **Ethical Compliance**: WHO guideline adherence score (0–100).  
- **Generalizability**: Performance across urban/rural, HIC/LMIC.  
- **Long-Term Viability**: Post-market performance decay rate.  

**Scoring Matrix**:  
- Weight evidence level (High=30%, Moderate=15%) and impact (20%) + technical robustness (35%).  
- Example: ICU Mortality Model scores 90/100 (High evidence, 15% AUC edge, WHO certified).

### **5. Recommendations for Metrics to Track**  
1. **Model Performance**:  
   - Accuracy/sensitivity (95%+ thresholds), AUC drift in post-market phases.  
2. **Clinical Impact**:  
   - Mortality reduction %, early detection lead time, adverse events.  
3. **Equity**:  
   - Adoption rates in LMICs, accuracy parity across demographics.  
4. **Cost**:  
   - Cost per correct diagnosis, cost per life saved, implementation fees.  
5. **Ethics**:  
   - % of models with bias audits, auditability score, human override usage.

### **6. Dashboard Specification**  
**Principles**:  
- User-Centered Design (clinicians + policymakers).  
- Real-Time Data Ingestion (EHRs, public health APIs).  
- Ethical Transparency Layer (WHO auditability status).  

**Pages**:  
1. **Overview**: Key metrics + model rankings (e.g., #1: ICU Mortality).  
2. **Clinical Impact**: Heatmap by application area.  
3. **Equity/Geospatial**: LMIC vs HIC performance.  
4. **Ethics/Cost**: Compliance scores vs budget impact.  
5. **Long-Term Surveillance**: Time-series trends.  

**Functional Requirements**:  
- Data: APIs from FDA, EHRs, WHO.  
- Alerts: Notifications for performance drops (<90% accuracy).  
- Export: Compliance reports for audit trails.
