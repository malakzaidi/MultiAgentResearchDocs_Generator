### **Knowledge Gaps Identified:**  
1. **Causal inference in AI models**: Most algorithms rely on correlations; understanding mechanistic links (e.g., why OMICS features predict resistance).  
2. **Regional disparities**: Longitudinal data to assess AI’s impact on healthcare equity in LMICs vs high-income settings.  
3. **Model generalizability**: Few studies incorporate socio-geospatial data with EHR-genomics (e.g., how urban vs rural populations interact with AI tools).  
4. **Ethical enforcement**: Gaps in tracking compliance with WHO guidelines in private sector AI commercialization.  
5. **Long-term surveillance**: Lack of post-market AI system performance tracking beyond 2–3 years.
