1. **Long-Term Outcome Studies**: Rare longitudinal data link AI-guided treatment adherence (e.g., diabetes chatbots) to 10-year mortality.  
2. **Cross-Cultural Generalizability**: Most models trained on North American/European data; limited validation in African or Latin American populations.  
3. **Regulatory Adaptation**: No global framework harmonizes FDA/EU/EMA approvals for AI as Medical Device (SaMD).  
4. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Minimal studies on clinician trust dynamics after AI errors (e.g., false-negative cancer cases).  
5. **Unintended Consequences**: Under-researched impact of AI reducing specialist demand in radiology/residency training pipelines.
