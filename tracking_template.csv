### **Instructions for Use**  
1. **Phase Updates**: Change “Ongoing” to “Completed” when a milestone is achieved (e.g., “Regulatory Approval” after FDA clearance).  
2. **Objective and KPIs**:  
   - Add *new rows* for emerging projects (e.g., AI in orthopedics or microbiome diagnostics).  
   - Update KPIs quarterly with the latest validation data from peer-reviewed journals or industry reports.  
3. **Owner Tracking**: Assign project leads/teams using named cell references (e.g., `=VLOOKUP("Regulatory Affairs", TeamList, 2, FALSE)`).  
4. **Status**: Use conditional formatting (e.g., Red/Amber/Green) to reflect progress.  
5. **Maintenance**:  
   - Monthly sync with internal workflow tools (e.g., Jira, Asana).  
   - Validate KPIs against source data (e.g., *JAMA Radiology 2024* for accuracy metrics).  
   - Add notes in adjacent cells (e.g., `=IF([@Status]="Completed", "Review closure report", "")`).
