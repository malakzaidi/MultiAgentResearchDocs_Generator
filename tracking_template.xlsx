**Notes for Updating and Maintaining the Template:**  
1. **Quarterly Reviews**: Refresh KPIs using primary sources (e.g., FDA, NEJM, WHO updates).  
2. **Validation**: Cross-check evidence levels (High/Moderate) with study footnotes.  
3. **Owners**: Assign data stewards for each row (e.g., NEJM, WHO, NCI).  
4. **Status Updates**: Mark "Active" for High-evidence deployments; "Pending" for preclinical/Phase I. Add "Gap" for unresolved knowledge blockers.  
5. **New Findings**: Insert rows for emerging studies, tagging Phase, Objective, and KPIs.  
6. **Automation**: Link to external APIs (FDA, WHO) for real-time trial/evidence sourcing.  
7. **Compliance Alerts**: Flag non-compliant systems (ethical/audit gaps) in red for stakeholders.
